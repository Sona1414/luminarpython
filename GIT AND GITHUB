git and github
--> both used for the same purposes
-->git can be used in our own local machine, so we downloaded
-->github is web based
=============================================
USES OF GIT AND GITHUB
============================================
-->git and github are known as VCS(VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM)
-->in vcs, we can commit each functionalities and older versions , so that we can easily switch to the
older versions as they are saved in vcs
-->in vcs, it has a remote location where we create a new folder first for our project,and the new folder
is called repository
-->from the repository which is in the github we have to clone the exact copy of the folder or repository
to the local computer ie clone is the command to get the exact copy of the things stored in repository
to the local system.At first the REPOSITORY WILL BE EMPTY
--->if the developer does a particular function in his local system , it will be available only in thet
system so it has to be copied or added to the repository in the remote location for this we use push
command
--->AFTER CLONe and pushing the functions to the remote repository,if another developer on his local system
requires the newly added function in the repository, clone should not be used because it only requires
the new function not everything in the repository so we can use the pull command to get the newly added
function to the other local machine from the repository

===================================================================

SO THE BASIC COMMAND
===============================================
CLONE-->>REMOTE REPOSITORY TO LOCAL SYSTEM(EXACT COPY)
PUSH-->LOCAL SYSTEM TO REMOTE REPOSITORY(NEW FUNCTIONS ARE ADDED)
PULL-->REMOTE REPOSITORY TO LOCAL SYSTEM(ONLY UPDATION)

THE ABOVE IS THE WORK FLOW
======================================================


WHILE WE SAY WE HAVE TO PUSH THE NEWLY CREATED FUNCTION INTO THE REMOTE RTEPOSITORY IT INCLUDES
CERTAIN MORE STEPS

1) WHEN WE CLONE, THE EMPTY REPOSITORY IS COPIED TO THE DEVELOPERS LOCAL MACHINE AND IT IS STORED IN ITS
LOCAL STORAGE AREA

2)IF A NEW FUNCTION IS CREATED IN THE DEVELOPER LOCAL MACHINE ,IT WILL BE STORED IN ITS LOCAL STORAGE AREA
AND FROM THERE WE CANNOT DIRECTLY PUSH THE NEWLY ADDED FUNC TO THE REMOTE REPO

3)WHILE USING THE GIT, A HIERARCHY WILL APPEAR

4)IN THE HIERARCHY FIRST WE HAVE STAGING AREA AFTER THE LOCAL STORAGE
SO FIRSTLY THE NEW FUNC CREATED IN THE LOCAL MACHINE WHICH IS STORED IN THE LOCAL STORAGE AREA HAS
TO BE MOVED TO THE STAGING AREA FOR THAT WE HAVE TO USE add command--git add filename

5)AFTER STAGING AREA, COMES THE LOCAL REPOSITORY, SO AFTER ADDING THE FUNC IN THE STAGING AREA IT HAS TO
ADDED TO THE LOCAL REPOSITORY AND ONLY FROM LOCAL REPOSITORY WE CAN PUSH THE FUNCTION INTO THE REMOTE
REPOSITORY--TO MOVE FUNC FROM STAGING AREA TO LOCAL REPOSITORY WE USE THE COMMAND----"git commit"
=======================================================================

COMMANDS
===============================
git clone--- from remote repo to local storage(exact copy)
git add -A--- add all the funcs from local storage area to staging area
git commit-- move the funcs from staging area to local repo
git push---from local repo to remote repo(new function)
git pull---from remote repo to local system(only updation)
git status--- list all untracked files
git init-- produces the hierarchy and make a connection with git
